The Kaiju Coding Clud is a Birmingham, AL based programming club, currently learning Python.

We are all learning as we go setting goals weekly and uploading our code to this repo.

Many of the clubs members are new and taking their first steps into pgoramming and computer science, this repo is very much a sandbox.
